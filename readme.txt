A collection of game projects I have worked on during my time as a student at DigiPen!

Throwdown: A puzzle game centered around throwing a ball.

Rainbow Fighter: Space Invaders with a colorful twist! 

Snake: Recreation of the all-time classic Snake game.

Vaccinator: A narrative puzzle game that tells the story of a red blood cell's quest to fix the human body.
